description: Breaking changes and deprecation policy
---

# Policy

GraphQL protocol provides a [smooth mechanism for breaking changes](https://graphql.org/learn/best-practices/#versioning): new features are added and deprecated are removed in some time, so there is no need to migrate from one API version to another.

The deprecation period will be no less than 3 months after an [announcement](deprecation-schedule.md) in deprecation schedule, but it depends on the feature usage - for the most popular features this period can last for 7 months or more.

[Check deprecation schedule.](deprecation-schedule.md)

While deprecated functionality remains available until the scheduled sunset date, users are encouraged to use the deprecation period to migrate to new functionality (check [migration guides](migration-guides.md)), or - if no functionality is available - notify about it in [telegram group](https://t.me/ever\_sdk). After the sunset date, deprecated versions will no longer be available.
