# SLA

## Uptime (availability)

Evercloud endpoint availability is 99.95

We do not include periods of unavailability of endpoints caused by underlying network issues in calculation of availability.&#x20;

#### [Check public endpoints status page](https://everos.dev/status)

## Response time

Average response time is 50ms for basic API functionality. Analytics functionality response time varies.&#x20;

Now when the API works on shared infrastructure. and some projects load it, others may be affected in some way and API may experience degradation.&#x20;

We are constantly working on API quality and with time, will eliminate this issue.&#x20;

If you want to have low response time you can purchase [Dedicated Cloud](../../use-cases/infrastructure-provider/).

## Limits

There is a limit of 100 connections per second from 1 IP. No additional limit policy is introduced yet. Soon, we will introduce query cost based limit policy.
